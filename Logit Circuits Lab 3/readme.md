# Digital Electronics Laboratory: Logic Circuit Implementation and Gates

## Introduction

This repository documents the experiments conducted in the Digital Electronics Laboratory, focusing on the implementation of logic circuits and gates. The primary objectives of the lab work include familiarization with the interpretation of datasheets for digital ICs, understanding basic methods of binary input and output, and application of tracing methods to a logic circuit.

## What is on the Written Report?

1. **Gate Symbols and Truth Tables:** Symbols and truth tables for gates such as AND, NAND, OR, NOR, NOT, XOR, NXOR. Emphasis on datasheets from TTL and CMOS families is required, considering pin configurations for simulation in TinkerCAD.

3. **DIP-SWITCH Usage** 
4. **LED Connection:** Investigate methods of connecting an LED as a digital output, considering the limited current of real gates.
5. **Logic Circuit Tracing** 
6. **Truth Table Evaluation**
