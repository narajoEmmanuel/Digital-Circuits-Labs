# Digital Electronics Laboratory: Logic Gate Families and Interfaces

## Introduction

This repository documents experiments conducted in the Digital Electronics Laboratory focusing on Logic Gate Families and Interfaces. 

The main objectives include understanding the electrical characteristics and differences between the TTL and CMOS families, verifying the non-ideal behavior of these families, and comprehending the importance of interfaces to achieve compatibility between TTL and CMOS families.
